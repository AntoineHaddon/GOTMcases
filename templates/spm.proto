!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! The module reads a namelist input file called spm.nml with the following 
! structure:
!  
! spm_calc:     logical: true: carry out SPM calculation; false: don't
! nclass:       number of grain size fractions
! spm_mode:     1: read from file (not yet implemented) 
!               2: calculate using advection/diffusion
! C_initial:    initial concentration, [kg/m3]
! grainsize:    vector of grain sizes of sediment [m], length nclass
! rho_s:        vector of density of sediment [kg/m3], length nclass
! dd_mode:      method of calculating sediment deposition 
!               0: no deposition
!               1: proportional to settling velocity and sediment conc.
! pp_mode:      method of calculating sediment pickup
!               0: no pickup 
!               1: pickup through reference concentration
! a_d:          vector of proportionality constants for deposition 
!               function, length nclass. Limits: 0<=a_d<=1.
! a_p:          vector of proportionality constants for pickup function
!               describes relative composition of sea bed in terms of
!               size fractions, length nclass. Limits: 0<=a_p<=1.
! tau_mode:     method to compute combined wave-current shear stress
!               1: linear addition, 2: Soulsby method
! tauc_mode:    method to compute current shear stress. 
!               1:  Soulsby method
! tauw_mode:    method to compute wave shear stress: 
!               1:  Soulsby method
! sd_mode:      method to calculate sediment diffusivity: 
!               1: linear
!               2: parabolic (Rouse profile)
! refconc_mode  method to calculate reference concentration: 
!               1: Smith & McLean (1977)
! taucrit_mode  include critical shear stress (1) or not (0)
! cnpar:        Crank-Nicholson parameter
! w_adv_discr:  advection method - see .../src/utils/ode_solvers.F90
! solver:       which ode-solver to use - see .../src/utils/ode_solvers.F90
